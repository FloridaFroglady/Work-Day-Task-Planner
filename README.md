# Work Day Task Planner


## Description

This is a simple app to allow users to plan their work day hour by hour for efficiency.  

## Usage

To plan your day, simply click in the field to the right of the hour for which you wish to add a task, then click the blue "save" button at the right of the row to save it.  The present hour is highlighted in red.  Past hours are grey, while upcoming hours are green.

## Credits

I had aid from a tutor for this. I did the day.js calls for the date and time myself, along with the conditional logic for the AM/PM labels, the conditional logic for the time classes (past, present, future) and the font-awesome icons. I also made some changes in the code that she helped me write so that data would go through the AM/PM logic instead of just console.log. She helped me with the DOM manipulation and how "this" works.  I had made previous attempts at this project trying to brute force code the rows with hours and AM/PM labels, so she showed me how much easier it was using a for-each loop.  I wrote all the comments myself after I finished the project, showing that I understand how the code works, I just needed some help getting there.
